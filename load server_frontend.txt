Sure — here are the commands for both backend and frontend:

---

### 🔁 **Backend Reload (FastAPI)**

If you're using **Uvicorn**:

```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

> Run this from inside your `backend/` folder.

---

### 🚀 **Frontend Start (Vite + React)**

```bash
npm install     # Only if you haven't already
npm run dev
```

> Run this from inside your `frontend/` folder.

---

Let me know if you want to convert this into Docker or make a dev script!
